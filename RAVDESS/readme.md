The RAVDESS dataset is too large to be hosted here.  

It can be downloaded for free at https://www.kaggle.com/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio.

After downloading, make sure to modify the script `mono.sh` in this repo's root directory to reflect where you have downloaded the audio files, ensure you have `ffmpeg` installed, and then run this script in order to convert all files to mono channel.
